    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve been professionally developing software since 2019 with an emphasis
      on back-end systems, web APIs, and Linux servers that are secure,
      performant, scalable, and maintainable. I’m accustomed to working
      effectively in a distributed team environment using agile methodologies on
      all aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m a passionate programmer focused on Bitcoin, Lightning, Linux, open
      source software, self-hosting, NixOS, and other technologies that enable
      privacy and freedom, collectively known as Sovereign Computing.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to build software that facilitates the spread of digital and
      financial self-sovereignty so that everyone has the opportunity to opt out
      of the current system.
    </p>

    <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
    <p>
      I have been professionally develping software since 2019. Prior to that, I
      provided IT systems administration and support for small businesses.
      Resume available upon request.
